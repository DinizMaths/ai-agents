# AI Agents

## ðŸ¤” What are AI Agents?

Imagine that you're asking a LLM model about the weather. The model will give you a response based on the data it was trained on. The LLM model can't give you a response based on the current weather because it doesn't have the ability to sense the environment. This is where AI agents come in. AI agents are programs that can sense the environment and act upon it. They can be used to automate tasks, make decisions, and interact with the environment.
